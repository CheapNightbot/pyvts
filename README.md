# pyvts


A python library for interacting with the [VTube Studio API(https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio).

## Basic Idea
Create a class `VTS` connecting to the server running on VTubeStudio (default port: `ws://localhost:8001`).

Implement functions in `VTS` to send/receive text messages to/from the server, to achieve developers' goals. For example, adding new tracking parameters to enable more actions on live2d avatars.
